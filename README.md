# Vaccines-for-Happy-People-Dataviz

**A data visualization created using Tableau and Tableau Prep. The data used was obtained from Kaggle.com**

This visualization, submitted on 6 August 2021, is a project I created for the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the class **CSCI 177i B** AY 2021-2022 Intersession (summer class).

The cleaned and combined dataset can be located in `Dataset > COVID 19 Vaccines and Happiness Rating of Each Country.csv` for the CSV file, and `Dataset > COVID 19 Vaccines and Happiness Rating of Each Country.tflx` for the TFLX file.

Datasets were obtained from Kaggle. Links to the datasets:
